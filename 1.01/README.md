# 327 Pokemon Game README - Gannon Guess

## Version 1.01
This program generates a grid "room" (21 x 80) of terrain that will be used for game areas
in future updates.
- Terrain is generated in rectangles of random size which may or may not overlap. This happens infrequenly
enough.
- 3-12 trees are generated for every room, and may or may not be overridden by paths, water, and buildings
- Paths are generated by choosing a random turning point part way through, so they are not all straight to the border, and then left or right.
- Centers and Marts are 2x2 buildings that are generated to connect to, most often times, the nearest path
